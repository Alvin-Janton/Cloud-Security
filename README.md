### Cloud Security Projects
---
### Introduction
This repository contains a series of beginner-friendly cloud security projects focused on AWS. Each project simulates a real-world scenario and demonstrates core concepts such as threat detection, data encryption, credential protection, and security monitoring.
These projects were completed as part of my self-guided learning to build hands-on experience with cloud-native security tools and services.

### Projects Included

This repository contains the following cloud security projects:

* **[Build a Security Monitoring System](./Project-1-Security-Monitoring-System/README.md)**
    * Demonstrates setting up proactive monitoring and alerting for sensitive data access using AWS CloudTrail, CloudWatch, and SNS.
* **[Threat Detection with GuardDuty](./Project-2-GuardDuty-Threat-Detection/README.md)**
    * Explores identifying and analyzing web vulnerabilities and detecting threats using Amazon GuardDuty against a deployed vulnerable application.
* **[Secure Secrets with Secrets Manager](./Project-3-Secrets-Manager/README.md)**
    * Focuses on implementing secure credential management practices by integrating a web application with AWS Secrets Manager and showcasing GitHub's secret scanning.
* **[Encrypt Data with AWS KMS](Encrypt-Data)**
    * Illustrates the fundamental concept of data at rest encryption by creating and using AWS KMS keys to secure a DynamoDB database.
