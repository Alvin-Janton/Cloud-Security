### Cloud Security Projects

### Introduction
This repository contains a series of beginner-friendly cloud security projects focused on AWS. Each project simulates a real-world scenario and demonstrates core concepts such as threat detection, data encryption, credential protection, and security monitoring.
These projects were completed as part of my self-guided learning to build hands-on experience with cloud-native security tools and services.
